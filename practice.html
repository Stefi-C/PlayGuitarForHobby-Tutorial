                                If you have a passion for music and the guitar but don't have a lot of time
                                or the patience to learn how to play, you may want to do it quickly. Although mastering 
                                the guitar can take decades, there are techniques and methods that you can use to rapidly
                                learn how to play the basics on guitar. By learning simple open chords, playing
                                guitar tabs, and practicing regularly and correctly,
                                you'll be able to play the guitar in no time.

                                                     sure that your guitar is tuned. Trying to learn how to play

                                                    Also, many guides that you find online will be using standard tuning.

                                                <p> When you are sitting down, there are two main ways to hold your guitar. For a casual playing style,
                                                     lay the guitar over your dominant leg. On the other hand, the classical method has you set your
                                                      guitar on your non-dominant leg. In both instances, make sure that the guitar is held close 
                                                      against your body. Holding your guitar properly makes it easier to play and prevents you from 
                                                      becoming fatigued.
                                                     Play around with both styles and figure out which one is most comfortable for you.

                                                    <li>The classical style gives you more control over the neck of your guitar.</li>
                                                    <li>The casual style reduces fatigue as you play.</li>
                                                    <li>Make sure that the guitar is upright while you play because tilting the guitar can hurt your wrists.</li>
                                                    <li>When standing, make sure that you have a strap on your guitar and that the guitar is tight against your torso, with the top of the guitar over your chest</li>

                                                <p> Chords occur when you play two or more notes on different strings simultaneously 
                                                    to create one unified sound. These are what make up the "rhythm" portion of acoustic music. 
                                                    Single notes are used more for solos and occur when you play a single note at a time.
                                                     Both are skills
                                                     that you must become proficient in when learning to play the acoustic guitar

                                                    Open chords are chords that are played towards the top of your guitar's neck, 
                                                    near the tuning knobs. When playing the acoustic guitar, knowing the open chord shapes is 
                                                    critical to play popular rhythms. Figure out two easy chords,
                                                     like E minor and A major, for example, to get an understanding of their shape

                                                     For instance, an A major is played by holding down the string on the second fret on the 2nd,

                                                     If your string is buzzing, move your finger further away from the metal fret on your neck

                                                        to create a different sound for your rhythm. Once you get a basic rhythm down,
                                                     you can start to incorporate quicker or slower strumming.

                                              a 2 means the second fret, and so on. Numbers in a progression mean that you hold down 
                                              the first individual fret and pick the note, then move to the next one, and so on in succession.
                                             Numbers on the same vertical line are meant to be played together simultaneously as a chord.

                                                    Practice switching between open chords like G, A, E, and C.

                                Everyone is creative deep down. When you play the guitar, you'll connect with that creativity and be able to express things more authentically. 
                                You'll also learn what it is to get into a flow state. This is the state of being fully immersed in what you're doing, such as playing guitar and enjoying it.
                                You don't have to be an expert guitar player to reap the benefits. Just picking one up and letting the music take over is enough.
